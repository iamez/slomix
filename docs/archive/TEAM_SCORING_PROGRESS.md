## ✅ COMPLETED WORK

### **Database Infrastructure** (Phase 1)

**Created Files**:
1. `tools/create_session_teams_table.py` (105 lines)
2. `tools/populate_session_teams.py` (215 lines)
3. `tools/normalize_team_assignments.py` (155 lines)

**Database Changes**:
- ✅ Added `session_teams` table (7 columns, 3 indexes)
- ✅ Populated with October 2nd data (20 records)
- ✅ Normalized team labels for consistency

**Verification**:
```
✅ Team A: SuperBoyy, qmr, SmetarskiProner (10 maps)
✅ Team B: vid, endekk, .olz (10 maps)
✅ All GUIDs stored as JSON arrays
✅ All names stored as JSON arrays
✅ UNIQUE constraints working
✅ Indexes created successfully
```

## ✅ COMPLETED WORK

### **Phase 1: Database Infrastructure** ✅

**Completed Files**:
1. `tools/create_session_teams_table.py` (105 lines)
2. `tools/populate_session_teams.py` (215 lines)
3. `tools/normalize_team_assignments.py` (155 lines)

**Database Changes**:
- ✅ Added `session_teams` table (7 columns, 3 indexes)
- ✅ Populated with October 2nd data (20 records)
- ✅ Normalized team labels for consistency

### **Phase 3: Bot Updates** ✅

**Completed Changes to `bot/ultimate_bot.py`**:

**✅ Todo #4**: Updated team composition function
- Added `get_hardcoded_teams()` helper method (60 lines)
- Updated `!last_session` to query `session_teams` table first
- Fallback to old Axis/Allies behavior if no hardcoded teams exist
- GUID-based player-to-team mapping

**✅ Todo #5**: Fixed MVP calculation logic
- MVP now calculated per hardcoded team using GUID matching
- Each player appears as MVP for only their actual team
- No more "vid as MVP on both teams" bug!

**✅ Todo #6**: Fixed team swap detection
- When hardcoded teams exist, no false swap warnings
- Shows "✅ Team Consistency - No mid-session player swaps detected"
- Only flags actual roster changes (GUID set changes)

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation** ✅

**✅ Todo #7**: Testing completed
- Created `test_hardcoded_teams.py` (150 lines)
- All 5 tests passed:
  - ✅ session_teams table exists
  - ✅ Found 2 teams for October 2nd
  - ✅ Team rosters have 3 players each
  - ✅ Team labels consistent across all 10 maps
  - ✅ All team GUIDs found in player stats

**✅ Todo #8**: Documentation and backup
- Updated `BOT_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` with session_teams system
- Documented normalization strategy
- Created backups:
  - `bot/ultimate_bot.py.backup_team_scoring_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
  - `etlegacy_production.db.backup_team_scoring_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

## 🔑 KEY DATA

### **Test Case: October 2nd Session**

**Team A** (GUIDs: 1C747DF1, 652EB4A6, EDBB5DA9)
- Players: SuperBoyy, qmr, SmetarskiProner
- Record: 8 wins - 2 losses (80%)

**Team B** (GUIDs: 5D989160, 7B84BE88, D8423F90)
- Players: vid, endekk, .olz
- Record: 2 wins - 8 losses (20%)

**Session Stats**:
- 10 maps played
- 20 rounds total (2 per map)
- Perfect 3v3 (no subs, no mid-game swaps)
- Stopwatch mode (teams swap Axis/Allies each round)

## 🗄️ DATABASE SCHEMA

```sql
CREATE TABLE session_teams (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    session_start_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    map_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    team_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    player_guids TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON: ["GUID1", "GUID2", "GUID3"]
    player_names TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON: ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3"]
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(session_start_date, map_name, team_name)
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_session_teams_date ON session_teams(session_start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_session_teams_map ON session_teams(map_name);
```

## 🐛 THE BUG (Reminder)

**Current Discord Bot Output**:
```
🔵 sWat: All 6 players (wrong!)
🔴 maDdogs: (empty)

🔴 maDdogs MVP: vid
🔵 sWat MVP: vid  ← vid is MVP on BOTH teams!
```

**Expected After Fix**:
```
Team A: SuperBoyy, qmr, SmetarskiProner
  Record: 8W - 2L (80%)
  MVP: SuperBoyy (correct stats)

Team B: vid, endekk, .olz
  Record: 2W - 8L (20%)
  MVP: vid (correct stats)
```

## 📝 NOTES FOR CONTINUATION

### **Bot File Location**:
- Path: `bot/ultimate_bot.py`
- Size: 193KB
- Status: Healthy, backed up

### **Commands to Update**:
1. `!last_session` - Main command showing team stats
2. MVP calculation - Currently broken (vid on both teams)
3. Team swap detection - Currently over-reporting

### **Key Functions to Modify**:
- `get_team_composition()` - Query session_teams instead of Axis/Allies
- `calculate_mvp()` - Calculate per actual team, not per role
- `detect_team_swaps()` - Compare GUID sets, not role changes

### **Database Query Pattern**:
```python
# Get teams for a specific session/map
cursor.execute('''
    SELECT team_name, player_guids, player_names
    FROM session_teams
    WHERE session_start_date = ?
    AND map_name = ?
''', (session_date, map_name))

# Parse JSON
for row in results:
    team_name = row[0]
    guids = json.loads(row[1])  # ["GUID1", "GUID2", ...]
    names = json.loads(row[2])  # ["Name1", "Name2", ...]
```

And we did! Phase 1 is complete! 🎉
