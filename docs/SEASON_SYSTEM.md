### Key Features

✅ **Automatic Season Calculation** - Based on calendar quarters (Q1-Q4)  
✅ **Current Season Tracking** - Leaderboards show current season by default  
✅ **All-Time Preservation** - Historical stats never lost  
✅ **Season Champions** - Track best players per season

## 🎯 How It Works

### Season Calendar

| Quarter | Months | Season Name | Dates |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Q1 | Jan-Mar | Spring | Jan 1 - Mar 31 |
| Q2 | Apr-Jun | Summer | Apr 1 - Jun 30 |
| Q3 | Jul-Sep | Fall | Jul 1 - Sep 30 |
| Q4 | Oct-Dec | Winter | Oct 1 - Dec 31 |

**Current Season:** 2025 Winter (Q4) - Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2025

### Season ID Format

Seasons are identified as: `YYYY-QN`

Examples:

- `2025-Q4` = 2025 Winter (Oct-Dec 2025)
- `2025-Q3` = 2025 Fall (Jul-Sep 2025)
- `2024-Q1` = 2024 Spring (Jan-Mar 2024)

---

## 🎮 Commands

### !season_info (or !season)

Shows current season information including:

- Season name and dates
- Days remaining in season
- Current season champion (most kills)
- All-time champion

**Usage:**

```text
!season_info
!season
```text

**Example Output:**

```text
📅 Season Information
2025 Winter (Q4)

📆 Season Period
Start: October 01, 2025
End: December 31, 2025
Days Remaining: 80 days

🏆 2025 Winter (Q4) Champion
SuperBoyy
Kills: 1,234 | K/D: 1.45
Games: 45

👑 All-Time Champion
SuperBoyy
Kills: 27,194 | K/D: 1.19
Games: 2,731
```text

### !leaderboard (Current Implementation)

Currently shows **all-time** statistics. In a future update, this will default to current season with an option for all-time.

**Planned Enhancement:**

```text
!leaderboard kills      → Current season (Q4)
!leaderboard kills all  → All-time stats
```python

## 🔧 Technical Details

### SeasonManager Class

Located in `bot/ultimate_bot.py` (lines 142-264)

**Key Methods:**

```python
# Get current season ID
season_id = season_manager.get_current_season()  
# Returns: "2025-Q4"

# Get friendly season name
name = season_manager.get_season_name()  
# Returns: "2025 Winter (Q4)"

# Get season date range
start, end = season_manager.get_season_dates()  
# Returns: (datetime(2025,10,1), datetime(2025,12,31,23,59,59))

# Get SQL filter for queries
sql_filter = season_manager.get_season_sql_filter()  
# Returns: "AND s.round_date >= '2025-10-01' AND s.round_date <= '2025-12-31'"

# Check for season transitions
is_new = season_manager.is_new_season("2025-Q3")  
# Returns: True (we're now in Q4)

# Get days until season ends
days = season_manager.get_days_until_season_end()  
# Returns: 80
```text

### Database Integration

The season system uses existing database tables - no migrations needed!

**Season-Filtered Query Example:**

```python
season_filter = self.season_manager.get_season_sql_filter()

query = f'''
    SELECT 
        player_name,
        SUM(kills) as total_kills,
        COUNT(*) as games
    FROM player_comprehensive_stats p
    JOIN rounds s ON p.round_id = s.id
    WHERE 1=1 {season_filter}
    GROUP BY player_guid
    ORDER BY total_kills DESC
    LIMIT 10
'''
```text

**All-Time Query Example:**

```python
season_filter = self.season_manager.get_season_sql_filter('alltime')  # Returns ""

query = f'''
    SELECT 
        player_name,
        SUM(kills) as total_kills
    FROM player_comprehensive_stats p
    JOIN rounds s ON p.round_id = s.id
    WHERE 1=1 {season_filter}  -- Empty string, no filtering
    GROUP BY player_guid
    ORDER BY total_kills DESC
'''
```sql

## 💡 Usage Examples

### For Players

```text

Player: !season
Bot: 📅 Shows 2025 Winter (Q4) with 80 days left
      🏆 Current champion: SuperBoyy (1,234 kills)
      👑 All-time: SuperBoyy (27,194 kills)

Player: !leaderboard
Bot: 🏆 Shows all-time kills leaderboard
     (Future: Will show current season by default)

```text

### For Admins

```python
# Check if new season started (for announcements)
if self.season_manager.is_new_season(self.last_season):
    await self.announce_new_season()
    self.last_season = self.season_manager.get_current_season()

# Get season stats for reports
season_filter = self.season_manager.get_season_sql_filter()
stats = await db.execute(f"SELECT ... WHERE 1=1 {season_filter}")
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always preserve all-time stats** - Never delete historical data
2. **Announce season transitions** - Keep players informed
3. **Highlight season champions** - Recognize quarterly achievements
4. **Use season filters wisely** - Don't slow down queries unnecessarily
5. **Test before seasons end** - Verify calculations for next quarter

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What happens to my all-time stats?**  
A: Nothing! All-time stats are preserved forever. Seasons are just a filtered view.

**Q: When do seasons reset?**  
A: Automatically on Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, and Oct 1 each year.

**Q: Can I see previous season stats?**  
A: Not yet, but this is planned for Phase 2.

**Q: Do I need to restart the bot when seasons change?**  
A: No! Season calculations are automatic based on the current date.

**Q: What if a player doesn't play during a season?**  
A: They simply won't appear in that season's leaderboard. Their all-time stats remain.
