Why this is a problem

Detecting errors early in Python code helps prevent runtime exceptions and improves code quality. Pyflakes provides a fast and safe way to find such errors without executing the code, avoiding side effects.
How to fix it

Review and fix the reported errors in the Python source code as identified by Pyflakes to ensure correctness and reliability.

SQL Injection

Avoiding SQL string concatenation: untrusted input concatenated with raw SQL query can result in SQL Injection.

Why this is a problem

Concatenating untrusted input directly into SQL queries can allow attackers to inject malicious SQL code, leading to data breaches, data loss, or unauthorized access. Using raw SQL without proper parameterization bypasses SQLAlchemy's protections.
How to fix it

Use SQLAlchemy's prepared statements with named parameters (TextualSQL), SQL Expression Language, or ORM methods to safely compose and execute SQL queries, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input.

Time to fix: 5 minutes
Why this is a problem

Unreachable code indicates dead code that will never run, leading to confusion, wasted maintenance effort, and potential bugs if the code was intended to execute.
How to fix it

Remove or refactor the code that appears after return or raise statements so that all code is reachable during execution.
Examples
Good examples

def example(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x
    print('Non-positive')

Bad examples

    return x

bot/services/

matchup_analytics_service.py

186
        full_hash = hashlib.md5(lineup_string.encode()).hexdigest()


Why this is a problem

MD2, MD4, MD5, and SHA1 hash algorithms are vulnerable to collisions, meaning different inputs can produce the same hash value. This can compromise security, especially when used for password storage or digital signatures, leading to potential attacks or data breaches.
How to fix it

Replace insecure hash algorithms with secure alternatives such as SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512. For password hashing, use dedicated algorithms like Argon2id or PBKDF2. Prefer using the 'cryptography' Python package over deprecated ones like 'Crypto' or 'Cryptodome'.
Examples
Good examples

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
# Create a SHA384 digest
digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA384())
# Update the digest with some initial data
digest.update(b"some data to hash")
# Add more data to the digest
digest.update(b"some more data")
# Finalize the digest as bytes
result = digest.finalize()
Why this is a problem

MD5 is not collision resistant and can be exploited to produce the same hash for different inputs, making it unsuitable for cryptographic signatures and security-sensitive applications.
How to fix it

Replace MD5 with a more secure hash algorithm such as SHA256 or SHA3 to ensure cryptographic security and collision resistance.
Why this is a problem

Accessing an instance member before it is defined can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior because the member does not yet exist or hold a valid value.
How to fix it

Ensure that instance members are assigned or initialized before they are accessed in the code, typically by defining them in the constructor or before any usage.
Examples
Good examples

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10
    def method(self):
        print(self.value)  # Access after definition

Bad examples

class MyClass:
    def method(self):
        print(self.value)  # Access before definition
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 10
