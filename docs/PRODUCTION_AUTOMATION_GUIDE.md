# 🤖 Production-Ready Automation System

> Complete automation enhancements for long-term production deployment

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Integration  
**Date:** November 2, 2025

---

## 📋 What's Been Added

You now have **6 major automation enhancements** ready to integrate:

### 1. 🏥 Health Monitoring System

- **Automatic health checks** every 5 minutes
- Tracks: uptime, errors, memory, CPU, database stats
- **Smart alerting** - notifies admins when issues detected
- Rate-limited to prevent alert spam (5-minute cooldown)

### 2. 📊 Automated Daily Reports

- **Runs daily at 23:00 CET**
- Posts summary of the day's statistics
- Includes: sessions, rounds, kills, top players
- Shows bot health status

### 3. 🔧 Database Maintenance

- **Runs daily at 04:00 CET** (low-traffic time)
- Automatic database backups (keeps last 7)
- Database optimization (VACUUM)
- Old log file cleanup (30+ days)

### 4. 🔄 Error Recovery

- **Automatic SSH reconnection** with exponential backoff
- Database error recovery with connection retry
- Tracks error counts per category (SSH, DB, tasks)
- Disables problematic features temporarily if needed

### 5. 🚨 Smart Alert System

- Health alerts sent to admin channel
- Rate-limited to prevent spam
- Severity levels: Info, Warning, Critical
- Actionable error messages

### 6. 👋 Graceful Shutdown

- Saves state before exit
- Posts maintenance notice to Discord
- Cleanly closes all connections
- Cancels background tasks properly

## 🎮 New Admin Commands

Once integrated, you'll have these new commands:

| Command | Description | Permission |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `!health` | Show comprehensive bot health status | Anyone |
| `!backup` | Manually trigger database backup | Admin |
| `!vacuum` | Manually optimize database | Admin |
| `!errors` | Show detailed error statistics | Anyone |

---

## 📦 Files Created

Your project now has three new files in `bot/`:

### 1. `automation_enhancements.py` (Main Code)

Contains all the new functionality:

- `AutomationEnhancements` class (mixin for your bot)
- Health monitoring methods
- Background task definitions
- Maintenance functions
- Error recovery logic
- Admin command definitions

### 2. `integrate_automation.py` (Integration Helper)

Helps you integrate the enhancements:

- Creates backups before changes
- Shows what needs to be added where
- Provides step-by-step instructions

### 3. `test_automation.py` (Testing & Validation)

Test and validate your setup:

- Check dependencies
- Validate configuration
- Test individual features
- Show integration status

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```powershell
pip install psutil
```

### Step 2: Run Tests

```powershell
python bot/test_automation.py
```

This will:

- ✅ Check if all dependencies are installed
- ✅ Validate your `.env` configuration
- ✅ Show integration status
- ✅ Run feature tests

### Step 3: Configure .env

Add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Admin channel for health alerts (can be same as stats channel)
ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here
```

### Step 4: Integration Options

You have **two options**:

#### Option A: Manual Integration (Recommended)

Follow the detailed guide in `bot/automation_enhancements.py`

1. Open both `ultimate_bot.py` and `automation_enhancements.py`
2. Copy the methods you want to add
3. Follow the integration instructions at the bottom of `automation_enhancements.py`

#### Option B: Guided Integration

Run the integration helper:

```powershell
python bot/integrate_automation.py
```

This will:

- Create a backup of your bot
- Show you exactly where to add code
- Provide step-by-step instructions

### Step 5: Test Your Bot

```powershell
python bot/ultimate_bot.py
```

Check the startup logs for:

```text

✅ Health monitoring task ready
✅ Daily report task ready  
✅ Database maintenance task ready

```

### Step 6: Test Commands

In Discord, try:

- `!health` - Should show bot health status
- Wait 5 minutes and check for health monitoring logs

## 📊 What Happens in Production

### Daily Schedule (CET timezone)

| Time | Task | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **04:00** | 🔧 Maintenance | Database backup, vacuum, log cleanup |
| **23:00** | 📊 Daily Report | Posts day's statistics summary |
| **Every 5 min** | 🏥 Health Check | Monitors bot health, sends alerts if needed |
| **Every 30 sec** | 🔄 SSH Monitor | Downloads new stats files (if monitoring active) |

### Error Handling

When errors occur:

1. **First error:** Logged, counters updated
2. **Repeated errors:** Exponential backoff retry
3. **Threshold exceeded:** Alert sent to admin channel
4. **Persistent failures:** Feature temporarily disabled

### Alerts You'll Receive

You'll get Discord notifications for:

- ⚠️ High error count (>10 errors)
- ⚠️ SSH connection failures (>5 errors)
- ⚠️ Database errors (>5 errors)
- ⚠️ Background task failures
- ✅ Daily database backups
- ✅ Daily statistics reports

- [ ] Verify backup was created in `bot/backups/`
- [ ] Check vacuum completed successfully

### Day 5-6: Load Testing

- [ ] Have multiple gaming sessions
- [ ] Verify all stats are processed
- [ ] Check error counts stay low

### Day 7: Health Check

- [ ] Run `!health` to see week stats

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Health monitoring not starting

**Solution:**

1. Check logs for "Health monitoring task ready"
2. Verify task is started in `on_ready()` or `setup_hook()`
3. Make sure `psutil` is installed

### Problem: Alerts not being sent

**Solution:**

1. Check `ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID` is set correctly in `.env`
2. Verify bot has permissions in admin channel
3. Check `self.error_alert_cooldown` - might be rate-limited

### Problem: Daily report not posting

**Solution:**

1. Check timezone setup (needs `pytz` or `zoneinfo`)
2. Verify bot is running at 23:00 CET
3. Check logs for "Generating daily report..."

### Problem: Backups not being created

**Solution:**

1. Check `bot/backups/` directory exists (created automatically)
2. Verify disk space is available
3. Check file permissions

### Problem: Tasks showing as "not running" in health check

**Solution:**

1. Check if tasks are started in bot initialization
2. Look for errors in task startup
3. Verify `@tasks.loop` decorators are correct

   ```text

2. **Health command** - Add to your commands:

   ```python
   @commands.command(name="health")
   async def health_command(ctx):
       # Copy from automation_enhancements.py
   ```

### Full Integration (All Features)

For complete production-ready automation:

1. Copy all methods from `AutomationEnhancements` class
2. Add all background tasks
3. Integrate error recovery in existing tasks
4. Add all admin commands
5. Configure `.env` with all variables
