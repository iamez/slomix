# Admin Flow Backbone Update
Date: 2026-02-05

## Summary
Added a Core Backbone row to the Full Stack Flow to orient newcomers around the three main pillars:
1) Game Server, 2) PostgreSQL, 3) Bot + Website.

## Why
The flow map was too dense for onboarding. This row gives an immediate mental model before diving into detailed layers.

## Changes
- Added `core_game_server`, `core_postgres`, `core_bot_web` nodes to the Full Stack Flow view.
- Added short caption explaining left/center/right meaning.

## Files Touched
- `website/index.html`
